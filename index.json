Penetration Testing Overview. A pentest is an organized, targeted and authorized attack attempt to test IT infrastructure, and its defenders to deternine their susceptibility to IT security vulnerabilities. A pentest aims to uncover and identify all vulnerabilities in the systems under investigation, and improve the security for the tested systems.\nMethods of Penetration Testing. External Penetration Test involves accessing external facing hosts, obtaining sensitive data or gaining access to the internal network.\nInternal Penetration Test involves testing from within the corporate network, also accessing isolated systems with no interet access; which may require on-site physical presence.\nTypes of Penetration Testing. Blackbox(Minimal) is a pentesting in which only essential information such as IP and domains are given.\nGreybox(Extended) is a pentesting in which additional information such as URL, hostnames and subnets are given.\nWhitebox(Maximum) is a pentesting in which every information is disclosed, inculding an internal overview.\nRed-Teaming is a pentesting involving physical testing and social engineering, associated with other pentests.\nPurple Teaming is a pentesting involving defenders, associated with other pentests.\nPentesting Laws and regulations   (USA) CISA Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  CFAA Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n  DMCA Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n  ECPA Electronic Communications Privacy Act\n  HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n  COPPA Children\u0026rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act\n  (UK) Data Protection Act 2018\n  Computer Misuse Act\n  Human Rights Act 1998 HRA\n  Police and Justice Act 2006\n  Investigatory Powers Act 2016 IPA\n  Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 RIPA\n  (Europe) GDPR General Data Protection Regulation\n  NISD Network and Information Systems Directive\n  Cybercrime Convention of the Council of Europe\n  E-Privacy Directive 2002\n  Precautionary measures during a penetration testing  Obtain written consent Conduct testing within the scope Take measures to prevent damage Do not access or discloses personal data Do not intercept electronic communications without consent Do not conduct test on systems covered by HIPAA without autorization  Penetration Testing Process Penetration testing process is defined by successive steps and events performed by a pentester to find a path to the predefined objective\nPenetration Testing Stages   Pre-Engagment involves creating necessary documents; discussing assessment objectives and clarifying any questions\n  Information gathering involves investigating the corporate website; identifying technologies and learning web application functions\n  Vulnerability assessment involves identifying vulnerabilities and investigating questionable features allowing unintended actions\n  Exploitation involves preparing exploit code, tools and environments to test the web server for potential vulnerabilities\n  Post-Exploitation involves resuming information gathering and examining the webserver from the inside. If found, we try to escalate our privileges\n  Lateral movement involves moving through the network to access hosts and servers; if they are in scope\n  Proof-of-concept involves proving the vulnerabilities exist and potentially automating the individual steps triggering the vulnerabilities.\n  Post-Engagement involves completing documentation and presenting a formal report deliverable to our client\n  \u0026hellip; See you stargazer on the next phase.\nFor the enlightened, there can be no denial of self.
