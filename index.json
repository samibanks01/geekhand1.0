Penetration Testing Overview. A pentest is an organized, targeted and authorized attack attempt to test IT infrastructure, and its defenders to deternine their susceptibility to IT security vulnerabilities. A pentest aims to uncover and identify all vulnerabilities in the systems under investigation, and improve the security for the tested systems.\nMethods of Penetration Testing. External Penetration Test involves accessing external facing hosts, obtaining sensitive data or gaining access to the internal network.\nInternal Penetration Test involves testing from within the corporate network, also accessing isolated systems with no interet access; which may require on-site physical presence.\nTypes of Penetration Testing. Blackbox(Minimal) is a pentesting in which only essential information such as IP and domains are given.\nGreybox(Extended) is a pentesting in which additional information such as URL, hostnames and subnets are given.\nWhitebox(Maximum) is a pentesting in which every information is disclosed, inculding an internal overview.\nRed-Teaming is a pentesting involving physical testing and social engineering, associated with other pentests.\nPurple Teaming is a pentesting involving defenders, associated with other pentests.\nPentesting Laws and regulations   (USA) CISA Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  CFAA Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n  DMCA Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n  ECPA Electronic Communications Privacy Act\n  HIPAA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n  COPPA Children\u0026rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act\n  (UK) Data Protection Act 2018\n  Computer Misuse Act\n  Human Rights Act 1998 HRA\n  Police and Justice Act 2006\n  Investigatory Powers Act 2016 IPA\n  Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 RIPA\n  (Europe) GDPR General Data Protection Regulation\n  NISD Network and Information Systems Directive\n  Cybercrime Convention of the Council of Europe\n  E-Privacy Directive 2002\n  Precautionary measures during a penetration testing  Obtain written consent Conduct testing within the scope Take measures to prevent damage Do not access or discloses personal data Do not intercept electronic communications without consent Do not conduct test on systems covered by HIPAA without autorization  Penetration Testing Process Penetration testing process is defined by successive steps and events performed by a pentester to find a path to the predefined objective\nPenetration Testing Stages   Pre-Engagment involves creating necessary documents; discussing assessment objectives and clarifying any questions\n  Information gathering involves investigating the corporate website; identifying technologies and learning web application functions\n  Vulnerability assessment involves identifying vulnerabilities and investigating questionable features allowing unintended actions\n  Exploitation involves preparing exploit code, tools and environments to test the web server for potential vulnerabilities\n  Post-Exploitation involves resuming information gathering and examining the webserver from the inside.

This is the next phase from the earlier documentation of my Hackthbox CPTS course.\nThe Shell - Every hackers Obsession. The shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.\nTypes of shell  Reverse shell - Initiates a connection back to a listener on our attack box Bind shell - \u0026ldquo;Binds\u0026rdquo; to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box. Web shell - Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive.  Note: Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established, before data can be sent. UDP utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no \u0026ldquo;handshake\u0026rdquo; and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. There are 65,535 TCP ports and 65,535 different UDP ports Web exploitation  We started with a simple nmap scan showing two open ports Discovered an instance of Nibbleblog Analyzed the technologies in use using whatweb Found the admin login portal page at admin.php Discovered that directory listing is enabled and browsed several directories Confirmed that admin was the valid username Found out the hard way that IP blacklisting is enabled to prevent brute-force login attempts Uncovered clues that led us to a valid admin password of nibbles  Note: Tips  Remember that enumeration is an iterative process. After performing our Nmap port scans, make sure to perform detailed enumeration against all open ports based on what is running on the discovered ports. Enumeration/Scanning with Nmap - perform a quick scan for open ports followed by a full port scan Web Footprinting - check any identified web ports for running web applications, and any hidden files/directories. Some useful tools for this phase include whatweb and Gobuster If you identify the website URL, you can add it to your \u0026lsquo;/etc/hosts\u0026rsquo; file with the IP you get in the question below to load it normally, though this is unnecessary. After identifying the technologies in use, use a tool such as Searchsploit to find public exploits or search on Google for manual exploitation techniques After gaining an initial foothold, use the Python3 pty trick to upgrade to a pseudo TTY Perform manual and automated enumeration of the file system, looking for misconfigurations, services with known vulnerabilities, and sensitive data in cleartext such as credentials Organize this data offline to determine the various ways to escalate privileges to root on this target There are two ways to gain a foothold—one using Metasploit and one via a manual process. Challenge ourselves to work through and gain an understanding of both methods. There are two ways to escalate privileges to root on the target after obtaining a foothold. Make use of helper scripts such as LinEnum and LinPEAS to assist you. Filter through the information searching for two well-known privilege escalation techniques. Have fun, never stop learning, and do not forget to think outside of the box!  Network Enumeration with Nmap  Enumeration involves identifying all the ways we could attack a target we must find.  POINTS FOR ACCESSING A TARGET SYSTEM include the following  Functions /resources which allow interaction with target or provide additional information Information that provides more important information to access the target Enumeration is the key Manual enumeration is a critical component  Firewalls Every firewall security system is based on a software component that monitors network traffic between the firewall and incoming data connections and decides how to handle the connection based on the rules that have been set.\nIntrusion Detection Systems / Intrusion Prevention Systems  IDS is alo a software based component that scans the network for potential attacks, analyzes them, and reports any detected attacks IPS complements IDS by taking specific defensive measures if a potential attack should have been detected  Note: In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be dropped, or rejected Detect IDS/IPS  We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not.  Decoys  With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (RND) a specific number (for example: 5) of IP addresses separated by a colon (:)  Enumeration Principles  Enumeration involves information gathering using active and passive methods. OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gatheing If we imagine that we have been hired to investigate the IT security of a company, we will start to develop a general understanding of the company\u0026rsquo;s functionality. For example, we need to understand how the company is structured, what services and third-party vendors it uses, what security measures may be in place, and more. Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there. The same can be said for understanding a company\u0026rsquo;s internal and external infrastructure, mapping it out, and carefully formulating our plan of attack. What can we see?  What reasons can we have for seeing it? What image does what we see create for us? What do we gain from it? How can we use it? What can we not see? What reasons can there be that we do not see? What image results for us from what we do not see?    Key Principles:  There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view. Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see. There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.  \u0026hellip; See you stargazer on the next phase.\nFor the enlightened, there can be no denial of self.
